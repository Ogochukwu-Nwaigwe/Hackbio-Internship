# The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)
What is TCGA?
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is an extensive and collaborative initiative aimed at advancing our knowledge of the molecular foundations of cancer by utilizing genome analysis technologies, such as large-scale genome sequencing. This project is a joint collaboration between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both of which are divisions of the National Institutes of Health, under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.The project was launched in 2006,bringing together experts from different fields and institutions . 
TCGA has collected data from patients with different kinds of cancers and the data has been used to carry out extensive research.Over 33 cancer types has been selected for molecular characterization by TCGA. The information gotten from this project is publicly available to the global research community, providing a valuable resource for cancer researchers worldwide.TCGA has led to the development of better cancer diagnostic tools, treatments, and prevention strategies.
The primary objectives of TCGA are to produce, ensure quality control, integrate, analyse, and interpret molecular profiles at the DNA, RNA, protein, and epigenetic levels for hundreds of clinical tumours, encompassing various tumour types and their subtypes(Weinstein et al., 2013).
The cancer genome atlas is a great cancer research that has produced large data sets which has improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer. TCGA has through molecular characterization deepened our understanding of cancer. Researchers have been able to detect anomalies, in gene expressions, DNA sequence, epigenetics, and protein expression and structure, thereby revealing different functional consequences. TCGA has propelled great growth in the computational biology field and has advanced health science and technologies. 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) produced enormous amounts of data, assembled research teams to analyse the data, and promoted the development of large-scale genomic characterization technologies, all of which significantly accelerated growth and advancement in the field of computational biology.

  <strong> Analysis Tools</strong>
</p>
  
Some of the tools created by researchers and contributors on the TCGA network that were used to analyse TCGA data include the following:
* The cancer Imaging Archive: TCIA is host to a large collection of medical images of cancer that are arranged according to research focus, imaging modalities, and common diseases. The primary file format is DICOM, and supplementary data such as genomics and patient outcomes are supplied.
* The Cancer Proteome Atlas Portal(TCPA): A comprehensive data portal for proteomic data access, visualization, and analysis.
* cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics: Provides tools for visualizing, analysing, and downloading large-scale cancer genomics datasets.
Other tools used to analyse TCGA data include; Copy Number Portal, DeMix, FASMICE, Firehose, Firebrowse, FunSeq2 , The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) , MBatch  Mutation calling using a Markov Substitution model for Evolution (MuSE) ,Regulome Explorer and SurvNet .

  <strong> Conclusion</strong>
</p>
In conclusion, TCGA has improved our understanding of cancer at the molecular level by providing comprehensive and publicly accessible resource of large-scale genomics data. It has advanced cancer research and enhanced personalized medicine, enabling more targeted and effective treatments.
The possibilities for advancements in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment are immense, indicating a future where cancer care becomes more precise and tailored to individual patients.
